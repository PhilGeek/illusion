\section{Introduction} % (fold)
\label{sec:introduction}

I have lost my grip on what a color illusion is meant to be. Perhaps I have simply lost my grip---not an alternative to be ruled out in advance of inquiry. However, I believe that there is an alternative explanation. I have come to suspect that there is nothing answering to the philosopher's conception of illusion. That's not to say that there are no color experiences that might, with propriety, be described as illusory. There is a familiar genre of books illustrating optical illusions, many essentially involving chromatic phenomena. No charge of false advertising is leveled here. It is only a distinctively philosophical conception of illusion whose claims are exaggerated. Or so I have, lately, come to suspect.
